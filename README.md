# Mary

#### Mary had a little lambda, whose fleece compiled lambda calculus to RISC-V

- This project is a compiler
- The input language is the untyped [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus)
- The output language is RISC-V assembly, targeting RV64I systems
- The implementation language is Haskell
- Among other reasons, I am writing this project to fulfill a project class at my college
- Name/pun credits go to Cassie @porglezomp: https://twitter.com/porglezomp/status/1189651774199566337?s=20
- Previous work towards this goal was written in Python with ANTLR4, but that code is not online
